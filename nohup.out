 For foreign national loans, borrowers typically need to put down at least 20% of the purchase price or appraised value, whichever is lower.

Can I do a cash out refinance on a vacant home?
 No, according to the guidelines provided, a cash-out refinance transaction cannot be done on a vacant home. One of the requirements states that "if the subject property was listed for sale within the past six (6) months prior to the loan closing date, then it must be taken off the market before the loan closing date." Since a vacant home is typically listed for sale, this requirement would not be met.

what options do I have for an empty home that is not listed for sale
 Option 1 (Not under contract): You can list the departure residence for sale without having a signed contract in place. However, you will need to provide a signed letter of intent from a potential buyer indicating their interest in purchasing the property. This letter should include details such as the proposed purchase price, down payment amount, and estimated closing date. Additionally, the borrower must be netting a positive number from the sale of the property or account for any funds they may have to bring to closing on the sale of the departure residence.

what is the minimum credit score do i need to qualify for a mortgage
 To qualify for a mortgage, you typically need a credit score of at least 620. However, this can vary depending on the specific program and lender requirements. It’s best to consult with a mortgage professional who can provide guidance based on your unique situation.

is 620 not a high score for a person who is 21 years old
 The FICO® Score range is typically between 300 and 850, so 620 would be considered a good score for someone who is 21 years old. However, it depends on their individual circumstances such as income, debts, etc., which can affect their credit score.

which mortgage companies can qualify me at age 21 with a credit score of 620 and what are the rate should I expect 
 There are some mortgage companies that may consider approving your application if you have a credit score of 620. However, it would depend on other factors such as income, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, etc. You might want to check with local banks or credit unions to see if they offer any first-time buyer programs that could help you get approved. As far as rates go, your rate will likely be higher compared to someone who has a higher credit score. It's always best to work on improving your credit score before applying for a mortgage so you can potentially qualify for better rates.

what is the minimum down payment expected for a good mortgage
 There is no specific minimum down payment required for a "good" mortgage. However, most conventional loans require a minimum down payment of 5%. FHA loans typically have lower down payment requirements, ranging from 3.5% - 10% depending on the borrower's credit score and other factors.

what benefits do i get if I make a down payment for 20% 
 Making a down payment of 20% can provide several benefits:

1. Lower monthly mortgage payments - By making a larger down payment, your loan balance will be lower, which means you will have less interest to pay over time. This can result in lower monthly mortgage payments.

2. Reduced private mortgage insurance (PMI) premiums - When you put down more than 20%, PMI is typically not required. Without PMI, you could save hundreds of dollars per year in premium payments.

3. Ability to refinance with better terms - With a higher equity stake in your home, you may qualify for better rates and terms when it comes time to refinance your mortgage.

4. Improved credit score - Making regular mortgage payments on time can help improve your credit score, which can lead to better loan options and lower interest rates in the future.

 There can be several potential disadvantages associated with obtaining a jumbo loan. One common issue is that they typically require higher credit scores and larger down payments than conventional mortgages. Additionally, interest rates for jumbo loans tend to be slightly higher due to their riskier nature. Another consideration is that some borrowers may find it difficult to sell their homes if they need to move quickly because there are fewer buyers who can afford a jumbo loan. Finally, jumbo loans often come with stricter underwriting guidelines and more extensive documentation requirements, which can add complexity and time to the lending process.

what happens if I default on my loan payments for more than 6 months
 If you default on your loan payments for more than 6 months, your lender can initiate foreclosure proceedings against your property. The specific steps involved in this process vary by state but typically involve sending several letters and making phone calls before ultimately filing a lawsuit to take possession of the property and sell it to recover the outstanding debt. Depending on local laws and other factors, you may also face legal penalties such as damages or fines. It’s important to stay in communication with your lender and explore options like loan modification or forbearance if you are having trouble making payments.

is it advisable to take additional insurance at closing 
 It depends on your specific situation and what type of additional insurance you are referring to. Generally speaking, if there are any gaps in coverage between when the new homeowner takes possession of the property and when their own personal insurance policy goes into effect, then taking out additional insurance may be a good idea. However, this should always be discussed with your real estate professional and insurance agent before making any decisions.

What is the Max seller contribution on a purchase?
 According to the information provided in Section 16, the maximum seller contribution on a purchase is six percent (6%) of the lesser of the property's sales price or the appraised value towards the buyer's closing costs, prepaid expenses, discount points, and other financing concessions. This includes funds contributed by the property seller and/or third parties. However, normal discount points and payment of the buyer's closing costs are excluded from this calculation.

What is the Max cashout I can get using only the rental income on an investment property?
 It depends on several factors such as the loan program, the LTV ratio, and the lender's policies. However, generally speaking, Fannie Mae allows up to 75% of the gross rental income to be counted towards qualifying income for a conventional mortgage. For example, if the rental income is $2,000 per month, up to $1,500 can be counted towards qualifying income ($2,000 x 75%).

explain to me in 3 bullet points Bankruptcy guidelines on an investment purchase
 Sure! Here are three key points about bankruptcy guidelines for investment purchases:
1. Applicants who have filed for Chapter 11, 12 or 13 bankruptcy within the past two years will likely be declined by most lenders.
2. For those who have filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, they can still qualify for financing after waiting periods ranging from one to four years depending on the type of loan being sought.

When is an appraisal update require?
 An appraisal update is required when the appraisal is over 120 days old and the property is not considered to be in a declining market. In this case, the appraiser will need to inspect the exterior of the property and review current market data to determine whether the property has declined in value since the date of the original appraisal report. This information will then be reported on Form 1004D.
